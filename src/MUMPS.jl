    module MUMPS

Both low-level interface with MUMPS $(MUMPS_VERSION) parallel direct solver C-library
as well as convenient wrappers for some common uses for MUMPS.

The central work is done by the `Mumps` struct, which mirrors the
internal structure used in MUMPS. Manipulations can be done directly
on this object and then passed to Mumps via the function [`invoke_mumps!`](@ref)
This mode of operation gives the user complete control as described
in the MUMPS manual, though it exposes unsafe operations, so beware.

More convenient are the use of the functions [`mumps_solve`](@ref), [`mumps_factorize`](@ref),
[`mumps_det`](@ref), [`mumps_schur`](@ref), and [`mumps_select_inv`](@ref), which all have
mutating counterparts (such as [`mumps_solve!`](@ref)). These can take matrices
and right hand sides directly, so, for example, the equation `A*x=y`, solved
in Base by `x=A\\y` or `LinearAlbegra.ldiv!(x,A,y)`, can be solved with MUMPS
as `x=mumps_solve(A,y)`, or `mumps_solve!(x,A,y)`.

The package also extends Base.det, Base.\\, LinearAlgebra.ldiv! and LinearAlgebra.inv to
work with mumps objects.

Note, unless working with the low-level interface, we discourage setting the `JOB`
parameter manually, as this can lead to unsafe operation.

The goal is to give the advanced user low-level access to MUMPS, while simultaneously
giving the ordinary user safe functions that grant access to most of what
MUMPS has to offer.
