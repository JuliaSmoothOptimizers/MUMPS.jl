Manipulations can be done directly on this object and then passed to Mumps via the function invoke_mumps! This mode of operation gives the user complete control as described in the MUMPS manual, though it exposes unsafe operations, so beware.\n\nMore convenient are the use of the functions mumps_solve, mumps_factorize, mumps_det, mumps_schur, and mumps_select_inv, which all have mutating counterparts (such as mumps_solve!). These can take matrices and right hand sides directly, so, for example, the equation A*x=y, solved in Base by x=A\\y or LinearAlbegra.ldiv!(x,A,y), can be solved with MUMPS as x=mumps_solve(A,y), or mumps_solve!(x,A,y).\n\nThe package also extends Base.det, Base.\\, LinearAlgebra.ldiv! and LinearAlgebra.inv to work with mumps objects.\n\nNote, unless working with the low-level interace, we discourage setting the JOB parameter manually, as this can lead to unsafe operation.\n\nThe goal is to give the advanced user low-level access to MUMPS, while simultaneously giving the ordinary user safe functions that grant access to most of what MUMPS has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"reference/#Base.finalize-Tuple{Mumps}","page":"Reference","title":"Base.finalize","text":"finalize(mumps)\n\nTerminate a Mumps instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#MUMPS.associate_matrix!-Tuple{Mumps, Integer, Vector, Vector, Vector}","page":"Reference","title":"MUMPS.associate_matrix!","text":"associate_matrix!(mumps, n, irow, jcol, vals)\n\nRegister the sparse matrix given in coordinate format with the Mumps object mumps.
